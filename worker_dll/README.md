# RunDLL
This directory contains the boilerplate for creating a DLL with a run function that will be called by the interface.  
Once compiled, rename it with the same name as the interface EXE and it should read the `usage:` parameters from the DLL FileDescription metadata.  
The FileDescription metadata is defined on the `.rc` file.
